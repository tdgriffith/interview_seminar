## Acknowledgement

I copied the presentation slides from [Claire Duvallet](https://cduvallet.github.io/) who's [previous reveal presentation I came across](https://cduvallet.github.io/phdchat-philosophies/), which itself relied heavily on [Christian Deiner](https://github.com/cdiener)'s [example presentation](https://github.com/Gibbons-Lab/ccmb_workshop).
